Used to keep track of racquets for JTC for deskStaff 
Very effective when people are just grabbing racquets and you just made them sign a racquet rather then signing a sheet that gets filled up and never organized. 

This is currently not deploy yet therefore if you want to use it you would need to download QT.creator framework then open the .pro file then build.
